International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ) is an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Armonk New York with operations in over 170 countries. The company began in 1911 founded in Endicott New York as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924. IBM produces and sells computer hardware middleware and software and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology . IBM is also a major research organization holding the record for most U.S. patents generated by a business (as of 2019  update  ) for 26 consecutive years.  5  Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM) the floppy disk the hard disk drive the magnetic stripe card the relational database the SQL programming language the UPC barcode and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe exemplified by the System/360 was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s. IBM has continually shifted business operations by focusing on higher-value more profitable markets . This includes spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 and the sale of personal computer ( ThinkPad / ThinkCentre ) and x86 -based server businesses to Lenovo (in 2005 and 2014 respectively) and acquiring companies such as PwC Consulting (2002) SPSS (2009) The Weather Company (2016) and Red Hat (Agreement Announced Oct 2018 actual acquisition date defined for 2H 2019). Also in 2014 IBM announced that it would go " fabless " continuing to design semiconductors but offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries . Nicknamed Big Blue IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of the world's largest employers with (as of 2017  update  ) over 380000 employees known as "IBMers". At least 70% of IBMers are based outside the United States and the country with the largest number of IBMers is India.  6  IBM employees have been awarded five Nobel Prizes six Turing Awards ten National Medals of Technology (USA) and five National Medals of Science (USA) .

Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885;  7  Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);  8  Herman Hollerith (18601929) patented the Electric Tabulating Machine ;  9  and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889.  10  On June 16 1911 their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott New York .  1   11  The five companies had 1300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton New York; Dayton Ohio ; Detroit Michigan ; Washington D.C. ; and Toronto . They manufactured machinery for sale and lease ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders meat and cheese slicers to tabulators and punched cards. Thomas J. Watson Sr. fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson called on Flint and in 1914 was offered a position at CTR.  12  Watson joined CTR as General Manager then 11 months later was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.  13  Having learned Patterson's pioneering business practices Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR's companies.  14  He implemented sales conventions "generous sales incentives a focus on customer service an insistence on well-groomed dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker".  15   16  His favorite slogan " THINK " became a mantra for each company's employees.  15  During Watson's first four years revenues reached $9 million and the company's operations expanded to Europe South America Asia and Australia.  15  Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name "Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company" and on February 14 1924 chose to replace it with the more expansive title "International Business Machines".  17  By 1933 most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company IBM.  18  NACA researchers using an IBM type 704 electronic data processing machine in 1957 In 1937 IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data its clients including the U.S. Government during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the Social Security Act  19  and the tracking of persecuted groups by Hitler's Third Reich  20   21  largely through the German subsidiary Dehomag . In 1949 Thomas Watson Sr. created IBM World Trade Corporation a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations.  22  In 1952 he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm and his son Thomas Watson Jr. was named president. In 1956 the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie New York laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but "learn" from its own experience. In 1957 the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961 IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter. In 1963 IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk New York . The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration participating in the 1965 Gemini flights 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission. An IBM System/360 in use at the University of Michigan c. 1969. On April 7 1964 IBM announced the first computer system family the IBM System/360 . It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor had a near-monopoly-level hold on the computer industry and became almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare.  23  In 1974 IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code .  24  IBM and the World Bank first introduced financial swaps to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement.  25  The IBM PC originally designated IBM 5150 was introduced in 1981 and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991 IBM sold printer manufacturer Lexmark . In 1993 IBM posted a US$8 billion loss - at the time the biggest in American corporate history.  26  Lou Gerstner was hired as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around.  27  In 2002 IBM acquired PwC consulting and in 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values hosting a three-day online discussion of key business issues with 50000 employees. The result was three values: "Dedication to every client's success" "Innovation that mattersfor our company and for the world" and "Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships".  28   29  IBM inventions: (clockwise from top-left) the hard-disk drive DRAM the UPC bar code and the magnetic stripe card In 2005 the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo  30  and in 2009 it acquired software company SPSS Inc. Later in 2009 IBM's Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama . In 2011 IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson which was exhibited on Jeopardy! where it won against game-show champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter . The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary in the same year on June 16. In 2012 IBM announced it has agreed to buy Kenexa and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies a web hosting service in a deal worth around $2 billion.  31  In 2014 IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for $2.1 billion.  32    better source needed   Also that year IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies including Apple Inc.  33   34  Twitter  35  Facebook  36  Tencent  37  Cisco  38  UnderArmour  39  Box  40  Microsoft  41  VMware  42  CSC  43  Macy's  44  Sesame Workshop  45  the parent company of Sesame Street and Salesforce.com .  46  In 2015 IBM announced three major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion  47  data storage vendor Cleversafe and all digital assets from The Weather Company including Weather.com and the Weather Channel mobile app .  48   49  Also that year IBMers created the film A Boy and His Atom which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016 IBM acquired video conferencing service Ustream and formed a new cloud video unit.  50   51  In April 2016 it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales.  52  The following month Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.  53  In October 2018 IBM announced its intention to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion.  54   55   56  Headquarters and offices [ edit ] IBM CHQ in Armonk New York in 2014 Pangu Plaza one of IBM's offices in Beijing China IBM is headquartered in Armonk New York a community 37 miles (60 km) north of Midtown Manhattan.  57  Its principal building referred to as CHQ is a 283000-square-foot (26300 m 2 ) glass and stone edifice on a 25-acre (10 ha) parcel amid a 432-acre former apple orchard the company purchased in the mid-1950s.  58  There are two other IBM buildings within walking distance of CHQ: the North Castle office which previously served as IBM's headquarters; and the Louis V. Gerstner Jr. Center for Learning  59  (formerly known as IBM Learning Center (ILC)) a resort hotel and training center which has 182 guest rooms 31 meeting rooms and various amenities.  60  IBM operates in 174 countries as of 2016  update   2  with mobility centers in smaller markets areas and major campuses in the larger ones. In New York City IBM has several offices besides CHQ including the IBM Watson headquarters at Astor Place in Manhattan .

IBM has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services. As of 2016  update  these offerings fall into the categories of cloud computing cognitive computing commerce data and analytics Internet of Things (IoT)  69  IT infrastructure mobile and security .  70  IBM Cloud includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS) software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public private and hybrid cloud delivery models . For instance the IBM Bluemix PaaS enables developers to quickly create complex websites on a pay-as-you-go model. IBM SoftLayer is a dedicated server managed hosting and cloud computing provider which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81000 servers for more than 26000 customers.  71  IBM also provides Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES) using cryptographic splitting to secure customer data.  72  IBM also hosts the industry-wide cloud computing and mobile technologies conference InterConnect each year.  73  Hardware designed by IBM for these categories include IBM's POWER microprocessors which are employed inside many console gaming systems including Xbox 360  74  PlayStation 3 and Nintendo 's Wii U .  75   76  IBM Secure Blue is encryption hardware that can be built into microprocessors  77  and in 2014 the company revealed TrueNorth a neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuit and announced a $3 billion investment over the following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power.  78  In 2016 the company launched all-flash arrays designed for small and midsized companies which includes software for data compression provisioning and snapshots across various systems.  79  IT outsourcing also represents a major service provided by IBM with more than 40 data centers worldwide.  80  alphaWorks is IBM's source for emerging software technologies and SPSS is a software package used for statistical analysis . IBM's Kenexa suite provides employment and retention solutions and includes the BrassRing an applicant tracking system used by thousands of companies for recruiting.  81  IBM also owns The Weather Company which provides weather forecasting and includes weather.com and Weather Underground .  82  Smarter Planet is an initiative that seeks to achieve economic growth near-term efficiency sustainable development and societal progress  83   84  targeting opportunities such as smart grids  85  water management systems  86  solutions to traffic congestion  87  and greener buildings.  88  Services provisions include Redbooks which are publicly available online books about best practices with IBM products and developerWorks a website for software developers and IT professionals with how-to articles and tutorials as well as software downloads code samples discussion forums podcasts blogs wikis and other resources for developers and technical professionals.  89  IBM Watson is a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data .  90  Watson was debuted in 2011 on the American game-show Jeopardy! where it competed against champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a three-game tournament and won. Watson has since been applied to business healthcare developers and universities. For example IBM has partnered with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to assist with considering treatment options for oncology patients and for doing melanoma screenings.  91  Also several companies have begun using Watson for call centers either replacing or assisting customer service agents.  92  In January 2019 IBM introduced its first commercial quantum computer IBM Q System One .  93  Research [ edit ] The Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights New York is one of 12 IBM research labs worldwide. IBM Fellow Benoit Mandelbrot discusses fractal geometry 1975. Research has been a part of IBM since its founding and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945 when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at Columbia University in New York City converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side into IBM's first laboratory. Now IBM Research constitutes the largest industrial research organization in the world with 12 labs on 6 continents.  94  IBM Research is headquartered at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York and facilities include the Almaden lab in California Austin lab in Texas Australia lab in Melbourne Brazil lab in So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro China lab in Beijing and Shanghai Ireland lab in Dublin Haifa lab in Israel India lab in Delhi and Bangalore Tokyo lab Zurich lab and Africa lab in Nairobi . In terms of investment IBM's R D spend totals several billion dollars each year. In 2012 that expenditure was approximately US$6.9 billion.  95  Recent allocations have included $1 billion to create a business unit for Watson in 2014 and $3 billion to create a next-gen semiconductor along with $4 billion towards growing the company's "strategic imperatives" (cloud analytics mobile security social) in 2015.  96  IBM has been a leading proponent of the Open Source Initiative and began supporting Linux in 1998.  97  The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBM Linux Technology Center which includes over 300 Linux kernel developers.  98  IBM has also released code under different open source licenses such as the platform-independent software framework Eclipse (worth approximately US$40 million at the time of the donation)  99  the three-sentence International Components for Unicode ( ICU ) license and the Java -based relational database management system (RDBMS) Apache Derby . IBM's open source involvement has not been trouble-free however (see SCO v. IBM ). Famous inventions and developments by IBM include: the Automated teller machine (ATM) Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) the electronic keypunch the financial swap the floppy disk the hard disk drive the magnetic stripe card the relational database RISC the SABRE airline reservation system SQL the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code and the virtual machine . Additionally in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time.  100  A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents . Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device IBM has been one of the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2018 the company holds the record for most patents generated by a business marking 25 consecutive years for the achievement.  5  Five IBMers have received the Nobel Prize : Leo Esaki of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights N.Y. in 1973 for work in semiconductors; Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer of the Zurich Research Center in 1986 for the scanning tunneling microscope ;  101  and Georg Bednorz and Alex Mller also of Zurich in 1987 for research in superconductivity . Several IBMers have also won the Turing Award including the first female recipient Frances E. Allen .  102  Current research includes a collaboration with the University of Michigan to see computers act as an academic adviser for undergraduate computer science and engineering students at the university  103  and a partnership with AT T combining their cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms to make them interoperable and to provide developers with easier tools.  104  The company is also involved in research into advanced algorithms and machine learning and their decision-making processes.  105  To that end the company recently released an analysis tool for how and why algorithms make decisions while scanning for biases in automated decision-making.  106  Brand and reputation [ edit ] IBM ads at John F. Kennedy International Airport 2013 IBM is nicknamed Big Blue in part due to its blue logo and color scheme  107   108  and also partially since IBM once had a de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits.  107   109  The company logo has undergone several changes over the years with its current "8-bar" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand .  110  It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo since period photocopiers did not render large areas well. Aside from the logo IBM used Helvetica as a corporate typeface for 50 years until it was replaced in 2017 by the custom-designed IBM Plex . IBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996 IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament one of the four major championships in professional golf with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996) the first course cam (1998) the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009) and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).  111  As a result IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the third female member of the Master's governing body the Augusta National Golf Club .  112  IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis with engagements at the U.S. Open Wimbledon the Australian Open and the French Open .  113  The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 19602000  114  and the National Football League from 20032012.  115  In 2012 IBM's brand was valued at $75.5 billion and ranked by Interbrand as the second-best brand worldwide.  116  That same year it was also ranked the top company for leaders ( Fortune ) the number two green company in the U.S. ( Newsweek )  117  the second-most respected company ( Barron's )  118  the fifth-most admired company ( Fortune ) the 18th-most innovative company ( Fast Company ) and the number one in technology consulting and number two in outsourcing ( Vault ).  119  In 2015 Forbes ranked IBM the fifth-most valuable brand.  120  People and culture [ edit ] Employees [ edit ] See also: List of IBM CEOs New IBMers being welcomed to bootcamp at IBM Austin 2015 Employees demonstrating IBM Watson capabilities in a Jeopardy! exhibition match on campus 2011 IBM has one of the largest workforces in the world and employees at Big Blue are referred to as "IBMers". The company was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934) survivor benefits (1935) training for women (1935) paid vacations (1937) and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946 and in 1952 CEO Thomas J. Watson Jr. published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education and 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . The Human Rights Campaign has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003  121  with IBM providing same-sex partners of its employees with health benefits and an anti-discrimination clause. Additionally in 2005 IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use genetic information in employment decisions; and in 2017 IBM was named to Working Mother   s 100 Best Companies List for the 32nd consecutive year.  122  IBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g. general management (GMLDP) human resources (HRLDP) finance (FLDP)). Each year the company also selects 500 IBMers for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC)  123  which has been described as the corporate equivalent of the Peace Corps and gives top employees a month to do humanitarian work abroad.  124  For certain interns IBM also has a program called Extreme Blue that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company's CEO at internship's end.  125  The company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM) Research Staff Member (RSM) Distinguished Engineer (DE) and Distinguished Designer (DD).  126  Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of Master Inventor . The company's most prestigious designation is that of IBM Fellow . Since 1963 the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924 and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas convened in Atlantic City New Jersey. Each year the company also selects 1000 IBMers annually to award the Best of IBM Award which includes an all-expenses paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location. IBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days a dark (or gray) suit white shirt and a "sincere" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.  127  During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s CEO Louis V. Gerstner Jr. relaxed these codes normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees.  128  The company's culture has also given to different plays on the company acronym (IBM) with some saying is stands for "I've Been Moved" due to relocations and layoffs  129  others saying it stands for "I'm By Myself" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm  130  and others saying it stands for "I'm Being Mentored" due to the company's open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels.  131  In terms of labor relations the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing  132  although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States.  133  In Japan IBM employees also have an American football team complete with pro stadium cheerleaders and televised games competing in the Japanese X-League as the " Big Blue ".  134  In 2015 IBM started giving employees the option of choosing either a PC or a Mac as their primary work device resulting in IBM becoming the world's largest Mac shop.  135  In 2016 IBM eliminated forced rankings and changed its annual performance review system to focus more on frequent feedback coaching and skills development.  136  IBM alumni [ edit ] Many IBMers have also achieved notability outside of work and after leaving IBM.
